# Project Name

API for DartBot - The Virtual Tour Guide Bot
DartBot (Tour Guide) provides prospective students with a tour of Dartmouth by (1) providing information about various locations across campus and directions to the next stop of the tour and (2) answering questions they may have using a Facebook Messenger ChatBot.

This repo contains the code for the API server backend portion of the project.

## Architecture

Our code is organized into three main repos: the API backend, the DartBot Tour Guide frontend and the Facebook Messenger bot using botkit.
The API stores Loc (Location) objects of sites on the tour.
We will be using mongodb and mongoose to store and access the API.
